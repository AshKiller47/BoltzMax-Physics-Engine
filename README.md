# BoltzMax-Physics-Engine
Engine Version: 1.0.0

BoltzMax is a lightweight 2D Physics Engine capable of Collision Detection, Contact Resolution, Restitution, Mass-Spring Modelling (Soft-Body Physics) and Gravity Simulation.

Demo programs for Collision Detection, Soft-Body and Star Merger (Gravity) Simulations written using BoltzMax and the Mighty SFML !

SFML installation required prior to compilation of the demo programs.

Compilation of the demo programs, when the engine is built using an IDE, requires editing 'Execution.hpp' and uncommenting the associated Identifier.
